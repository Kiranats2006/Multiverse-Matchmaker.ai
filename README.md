# Multiverse-matchmaker.ai

## Description

An AI-powered web application where users create multiverse personas and get matched with Marvel characters, who can chat back. Built with React, Node.js backend, LangChain, and the Gemini API.

## Project Idea

Multiverse Matchmaker combines generative AI with interactive roleplay. A user inputs their description, and the system generates alternate versions of them across Marvel’s multiverse. The twist is matchmaking—users get paired with Marvel characters (e.g., Loki, Wanda, or Spider-Man) who respond conversationally as if they were real.

This makes the app part game, part simulator, and part GenAI exploration.

## Technical Implementation

1. **Frontend (React)**

   * User registration/login.
   * Profile creation with self-description.
   * Swipe interface to explore alternate personas.
   * Chatbox UI for interaction with Marvel characters.

2. **Backend (Node.js + Express)**

   * Handles authentication and API routing.
   * Stores user data, generated personas, and chat history.
   * Connects frontend to LangChain + Gemini API.

3. **LangChain + Gemini API (AI Layer)**

   * **LangChain Orchestration**:

     * Chains prompts for persona creation.
     * Manages role-based responses for Marvel characters.
     * Context management for conversations.
   * **Gemini API**:

     * Generates alternate personas.
     * Powers roleplay conversations.

4. **Database (MongoDB)**

   * Stores user details, personas, and chats.
   * Ensures scalability and quick retrieval.

## Theoretical Implementation

* **Generative AI** is used for creative storytelling.
* **LangChain** structures prompt flows and memory for chatbots.
* **Scalability** ensured by modular backend with API endpoints.
* **Efficiency** achieved by caching and minimal database lookups.
* **Correctness** validated through prompt engineering and structured persona generation.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Correctness**

   * APIs return accurate personas and character responses matching user input.
2. **Efficiency**

   * Optimized LangChain flows reduce redundant calls to Gemini.
   * Database indexed for fast queries.
3. **Scalability**

   * Modular backend with Express routes.
   * MongoDB handles large datasets.
   * Stateless APIs allow horizontal scaling.

## Future Enhancements

* Add voice-based interaction.
* Expand to non-Marvel universes (Star Wars, DC, etc.).
* Personalization using fine-tuned models.
